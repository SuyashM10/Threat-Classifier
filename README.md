**Introduction**

Spam SMS be unwanted messages to 
users, which be worrying and from time to time 
damaging. present be a group of survey papers 
available on SMS spam detection techniques. 
study and reviewed their used techniques, 
approaches and algorithms, their advantages and 
disadvantages, evaluation measures, discussion on 
datasets as well as lastly end result judgment of 
the studies. even though, the SMS spam detection 
techniques are additional demanding than SMS 
spam detection techniques since of the local 
contents, use of shortened words, unluckily not 
any of the existing research addresses these 
challenges.

Conclusion:

This paper present the result of the systematic 
literature review on SMS spam detection. We 
chose a total of 13 research paper on this field and 
reviewed their proposed techniques. Advantages 
and disadvantages. And challenges they 
addressed. we also examined their evaluation  
procedures. We demonstrated the publicly 
available dataset information  which is a prior 
need for a spam filtering algorithm.
